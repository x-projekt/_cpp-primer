**Answer**: arrays are not pointers! Although in some contexts, the compiler decays the array name to a pointer to its first element, the array and pointer compound-types are fundamentally different.

The cornerstone of the equivalence between arrays and pointers is the following statement:

> A reference to an object of type array-of-T which appears in an expression _decays_ (with three exceptions) into a pointer to its first element; the type of the resultant pointer is pointer-to-T.
>  - The exception is when the array is an operand of: `sizeof`, `&` operators or a string literal initializer for a character array.
 
So, when we say "arrays and pointers are equivalent", it means that it's the pointer arithmetic and array indexing that is equivalent; pointers and arrays are different.
 - Given an array `a` and pointer `p`, an expression of the form `a[i]` causes the array to decay into a pointer, following the rule above, and then to be sub-scripted just as would be a pointer variable in the expression `p[i]`.
