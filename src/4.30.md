**Answers**:
 - (a) `sizeof x + y` --> `sizeof(x) + y` - `sizeof` operator has higher precedence than `binary-+` operator.
 - (b) `sizeof p->mem[i]` --> `sizeof((p->mem)[i])` - member-access operator, i.e. `->`, and the sub-script operator, i.e. `[]`, have the same precedence level; and are grouped according to left-associativity. These operators in-turn have higher precedence than the `sizeof` operator.
 - (c) `sizeof a < b` --> `sizeof(a) < b` - `sizeof` has higher precedence than the relational operators.
 - (d) `sizeof f()` --> `sizeof(f())` - function-call operator, i.e. `()` has higher precedence than `sizeof`.
